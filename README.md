# Luxocator

ussage:
    Open the ImageSess*.py.
    
    In line 57 input your own bing search Api key
    then save it.

    Return to the repo and input the command
    ./build.sh.

    Then in dist/Luxocator the executable program was built.

    cd to dist and ./Luxocator
    It works with Internet

    The project based on the Luxocator in OpenCV for Secret Agent by Joseph Howse
    Thank you for your watching. LOL
